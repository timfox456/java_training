# Java Training Materials

Welcome to the `java_training` repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for a corporate Java training course, covering a wide range of essential Java concepts and modern development practices.

The materials are structured into different sections, each focusing on specific aspects of Java programming and its ecosystem.

## Course Structure Overview

This training is designed to provide hands-on experience and a deep understanding of Java, from foundational concepts to advanced enterprise application development.

Key areas covered include:
